Hi Jonathan,
   I'm attaching my outline/draft of the paper.  I am still working on 
generating the last two figures (one like figure 2 of Franken's paper and 
a bar plot comparing all the tau values), but I thought it would be 
useful to start working on the text now. 

So far this is a really rough draft.  I borrowed some of your language 
from you powerpoint presentation to get things started and I have outlines
in some of the sections.

Could you write the Materials and Methods section?  I will probably also
need help with the Discussion and the Background sections, but I'd like 
to at least take a shot at the Background to force myself to learn it.

I'm writing the paper using latex since that's what I like and it's really 
good for equations and figures and references.  If you would like to 
include a reference, just tell me the author and year and I can add it 
no problem.

Thanks,
Michael
