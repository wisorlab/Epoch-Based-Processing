Epoch-Based-Processing
======================

Scripts categorized within 'Epoch Based Processing' are scripts which extract specific segments, or 'epochs', from a train of data (for instance, seperating a 1 hour segment from a 12 hour recording; or extracting small windows of data at a specific interval).  These scripts differ from those in the 'Data-Stream-Processing' category in that they do not analyize the entire distribution of data, but only at specific epochs within the whole.
